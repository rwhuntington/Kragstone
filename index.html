				<p>Kragstone Press, LLC was began as a small self-started project by Rick Huntington. What began as a simple way of self-publishing quickly grew into a company dedicated to supporting new and small-name authors throughout the publishing process. From proofreading and editing services, to all out publishing support, Kragstone Press helps to fill the knowledge gap for authors.</p>
				<p>By mid-2024, Kragstone Press, LLC grew to include Laura B. Huntington, Rick's wife and dedicated educator who took it upon herself to not only teach the next generation, but to inspire them to create their own worlds and amazing characters.</p>
