			<h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
			<p>Kragstone Press, LLC was established in 2023 just as I was finishing the "final" draft of A War for Iron & Stone. What began as a simple hobby project in 2021 quickly grew into a mission to publish. Like many other new authors, I travelled down the rabbit holes of indie publishing and traditional publishing, and all the headaches involved in between.</p>
			<p>Deciding to start my own publishing company came from the desire to not only publish my own work under my own company, but also to have an avenue to provide support to other authors in the form of editing, coaching, and publishing.</p>
